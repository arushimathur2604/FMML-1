Inner Product
The inner product is the scalar multiplication of one vector (or matrix) and the transpose of another vector (or matrix).
If both arrays are 1D arrays, their dimensions should be identical.
If either or both arrays are higher-dimensional, then the last dimensions of both arrays should be identical.

a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,-1,0]])
 b = np.array([6,3,2])
 z = np.inner(a,b)
 print(z)
O/P:
[18 21]

# The same results can be obtained using the dot method as follows.
a.dot(b.T)
O/P:
array([18, 21])
