Transpose of Matrix<br>
Matrix transpose is performed with the transpose method on a nested list or a Python array, or a higher-dimensional Numpy array.<br>
# Transpose of a Matrix (as nested list)
 a = [[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5]]
 b = np.transpose(a)
 print('a\n',a)
 print('b\n',b)<br>
Output:<br>
a
 [[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5]]
b
 [[1 2]
 [2 3]
 [3 4]
 [4 5]]
