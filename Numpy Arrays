Numpy Arrays
A NumPy array is a Numpy object upon which the dot method can be performed as below. However, this method accepts only NumPy arrays to operate on.

# convert lists into NumPy arrays
 newa = np.array(a)
 newb = np.array(b)
 z = newa.dot(newb)
 print(z)
O/P:
[[-1 -1 25]
 [ 6 10 22]
 [31 27 19]]
